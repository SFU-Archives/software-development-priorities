# Software Development Priorities

This site tracks possible feature enhancements for the open-source software applications used by SFU Archives. These are primarily [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/), [Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/), and [ePADD](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd).

The main purpose of the list is to support planning when the Archives sponsors software development via contract. But the Archives can also draw on the list whenever it has an opportunity to comment on the development roadmap of one of these software projects.

Features are registered on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues). Each entry:
- Provides a brief feature description.
- Includes tags to assign priority (High, Medium, Low) and type (Archivematica, AtoM etc).
- Includes comments as needed.

SFU archivists review / reassign priorities at the end of a development contract or beginning of planning for a new one.

After a review, the [Current Register](current-register.md) is updated. This provides a listing of features, grouped by priority. It includes fuller descriptions where applicable (typically for high-priority items), and provides more detail about requirements, options etc. This document was last revised in **November 2021**. Previous versions are stored on the Archives' shared drive at ITM002-02 Planning.

The [Development Contracts page](development-contracts/00-intro.md) lists past projects, summarizing the work sponsored by them.
