# Software Development Priorities

This repository tracks possible feature-development work that SFU Archives could sponsor in the open-source software projects in which it participates, mainly Archivematica and Access-to-Memory (AtoM).

The Archives first created a features wishlist in March 2013, and it has been updated over the years in various formats as Word documents, then on the Archives' internal wiki. In July 2020 we moved the list to our GitHub site to facilitate updates and version control and to make it easier to share with other institutions and developers.

Features are registered on the Issues tabs and assigned a priority tag (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Rejected, Implemented). Tags are also used to group features by type (Archivematica, AtoM, Archivematica-AtoM integration, etc).

Each development contract (starting with 2019-20) has its own page or folder, with a brief description of work done and any reports or other documentation that can be shared.
