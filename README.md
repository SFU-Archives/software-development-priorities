# Software Development Priorities

This repository tracks possible feature enhancements for the open-source software applications used by SFU Archives. These are primarily [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) and [Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/). Over time others may be included as the Archives incorporates them into its workflows (e.g. [ePADD](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd)).

The main purpose of the list is to support planning when the Archives has funds for a software development contract. But the Archives can also draw on the list whenever it has an opportunity to provide input on the development roadmap of any given application.

## Maintenance
Register features as Issues. Assign each a priority tag (High, Medium, Low) and type tag (Archivematica, AtoM, ePADD etc). Priorities should be periodically reviewed / reassigned, typically at the end of a development contract or beginning of planning for a new one.

Create a separate page or folder for each development contract (starting with 2019-20), giving a brief description of work done; upload any reports or other documentation that can be reasonably shared.

## Previous version
The Archives first created a features wishlist in March 2013. Over the years, it has been updated in various formats â€“ mainly as Word documents, then on the Archives' internal wiki. In July 2020 we moved it to this GitHub repository to facilitate updates and version control and to make it easier to share with other institutions and developers.
