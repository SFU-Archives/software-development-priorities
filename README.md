# Software Development Priorities

This repository tracks possible feature-development work that SFU Archives could sponsor in the open-source software projects in which it participates â€“ primarily Archivematica and Access-to-Memory (AtoM).

The Archives first created a features wishlist in March 2013. Over the years, the list has been updated in various formats as Word documents, then on the Archives' internal wiki. In July 2020 we moved it to this GitHub repository to facilitate updates and version control and to make it easier to share with other institutions and developers.

The Issues tabs is used to register features. Each is assigned a priority tag (High, Medium, Low, Rejected), and there are various type tags (Archivematica, AtoM, Archivematica-AtoM integration, etc).

Each development contract (starting with 2019-20) has its own page or folder, with a brief description of work done and any reports or other documentation that can be shared.
