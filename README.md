# Software Development Priorities

This repository tracks possible feature enhancements for the open-source software applications used by SFU Archives. These are primarily [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) and [Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/). Over time others may be included as the Archives incorporates them into its workflows (e.g. [ePADD](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd)).

## Purpose
The main purpose of the list is to support planning when the Archives has funds to sponsor software development via contract. But the Archives can also draw on the list whenever it has an opportunity to provide input on the development roadmap of any given application.

## Structure
Features are registered on the Issues tab, using tags to assign priority (High, Medium, Low) and type (Archivematica, AtoM, ePADD etc). Priorities should be periodically reviewed / reassigned, typically at the end of a development contract or beginning of planning for a new one.

Each development contract has its own page, giving a brief description of work done.

## History
The Archives first created a features wishlist in March 2013. Over the years, it has been updated in various formats â€“ mainly as Word documents, then on the Archives' internal wiki. In July 2020 we moved it to this GitHub repository in order to facilitate maintenance and make it easier to share with other institutions and developers.
