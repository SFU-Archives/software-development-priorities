# Software Development Priorities

This site tracks possible feature enhancements for the open-source software applications used by SFU Archives. These are primarily [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/), [Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/), and [ePADD](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd)).

The main purpose of the list is to support planning when the Archives sponsors software development via contract. But the Archives can also draw on the list whenever it has an opportunity to provide input on the development roadmap of one of these software projects.

Register features on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues). Provide a very brief description; use tags to assign priority (High, Medium, Low) and type (Archivematica, AtoM etc), and add comments as needed. Priorities should be periodically reviewed / reassigned, typically at the end of a development contract or beginning of planning for a new one.

The [Current Register](current-register.pdf) is maintained as Word / PDF document to facilitate reference. It includes fuller feature descriptions where applicable (typically for high-priority items), and provides more details about requirements, options etc. This document was last revised in December 2020. Previous versions are stored on the Archives' shared drive at ITM002-02 Planning.

The [Development Contracts page](development-contracts/00-intro.md) lists past projects, summarizing the work sponsored by them.
