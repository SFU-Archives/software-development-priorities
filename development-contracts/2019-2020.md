### Archivematica column pickers
Jun–Jul 2020. Allow users to choose which fields to display in the lists on Archivematica's `Backlog` and `Archival storage` tabs. [Implement issue 8](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/8).

#### Improvements in the display of digital object metadata in AtoM
Jul 2020–Jan 2021. Display metadata (e.g. file formats) separately for originals, preservation and access copies. Make clear when a digital object exists in AtoM (can be directly accessed) vs when a digital object exists (and can be requested) but has not been uploaded to AtoM (for privacy or copyright reasons) and cannot be directly accessed. [Implements issue 10](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/10)
