# 2019-21 Development Contract
This contract with Artefactual Systems began Sep 2019 and was completed in Jan 2021. The project began with a scoping report to narrow down the Archives' development priorities and provide costs estimates, followed by implementation on four features. An unexpected complication was the requirement (from SFU IT Services) to migrate the Archives' VM infrastructure to SFU's new self-service cloud model. The migration took longer than anticipated (and is still in progress as of Feb 2021); it created delays for QA testing and final deployment of new features.

## Scoping
Scoping report delivered Jan 2020. Description and estimates for 4 features,

## Archivematica column pickers

Included in [Archivematica release 1.12](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.12.0_and_Storage_Service_0.17.0_release_notes).

## Archivematica configuration selector

### Improvements in the display of digital object metadata in AtoM
Jul 2020–Jan 2021. Display metadata (e.g. file formats) separately for originals, preservation and access copies. Make clear when a digital object exists in AtoM (can be directly accessed) vs when a digital object exists (and can be requested) but has not been uploaded to AtoM (for privacy or copyright reasons) and cannot be directly accessed. [Implements issue 10](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/10). Scheduled for inclusion in [AtoM release 2.7](https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/wiki/Releases/Roadmap#Release_2.7).
