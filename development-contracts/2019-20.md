# 2019-20 Development Contract

SFU Archives contracted with Artefactual Systems Inc to sponsor development work in AtoM and Archivematica. The contract had two parts: a [scoping project](#scoping-project) and a [development project](#development-project)

## Scoping project
Sep 2019-Jan 2020.

SFU Archives and Artefactual reviewed the Archives' development wishlist and identified priorities. Artefactual scoped out work requirements on a number of features and provided cost estimates.

## Development project
Beginning Apr 2020, in progress.

SFU Archives and Artefactual reviewed the scoping report and agreed to proceed with four features; these are tagged on the Issues tab as `in progress`.

#### Archivematica column pickers ####
Allow users to choose which fields to display in the lists on Archivematica's `Backlog` and `Archival storage` tabs. [Implements Issue 8](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/8)

#### Archivematica configuration selector ####
Let users select a processing configuration when starting a transfer in the Archivematica Dashboard. [Implements Issue 9](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/9)

#### Improvements in the display of digital object metadata in AtoM ####
Display metadata (e.g. file formats) separately for originals, preservation and access copies. Make clear when a digital object exists in AtoM (can be directly accessed) vs when a digital object exists (and can be requested) but has not been uploaded to AtoM (for privacy or copyright reasons) and cannot be directly accessed. [Implements Issue 10](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/10)

#### CAS integration ####
Allow Archives' staff to log on to both Archivematica and AtoM via the university's Central Authentication Service using their SFU computing ID. [Implements Issue 28](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/28)
