# 2019-20 Development Contract

SFU Archives contracted with Artefactual Systems Inc to sponsor development work in AtoM and Archivematica. It falls into two parts: a scoping project and a development project.

In the **scoping project** (Sep 2019-Jan 2020) SFU Archives and Artefactual reviewed the Archives' features wishlist and identified priorities. Artefactual scoped out work requirements on a number of features and provided cost estimates.

In the **development project** (beginning Apr 2020, in proress) the Archives and Artefactual reviewed the scoping report and agreed to proceed with four features. These are tagged on the Issues tab as `in progress`.
* [Column pickers in Archivematica's `Backlog` and `Archival storage` tabs](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/8), allowing users to choose which fields to display in lists of backlog packages and AIPs.
* [An Archivematica configuration selector](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/9) that lets users select a processing configuration when starting a transfer in the Dashboard.
* [Improvements in the display of digital object metadata in AtoM](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/10) distinguishing between the file formats of originals, preservation and access copies; and allowing users to see more clearly when a digital object exists (and can be requested) but is not displayed in AtoM (for privacy or copyright reasons).
* [CAS integration](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/28) allowing Archives staff to log on to both Archivematica and AtoM via the university's Central Authentication Service using their SFU computing ID.
