# 2019-20 Development Contract

SFU Archives contracted with Artefactual Systems Inc to sponsor development work in AtoM and Archivematica. It falls into two parts: a [scoping project](#scoping-project) and a [development project](#development-project)

## Scoping project
* Sep 2019-Jan 2020.
* SFU Archives and Artefactual reviewed the Archives' development wishlist and identified priorities.
* Artefactual scoped out work requirements on a number of features and provided cost estimates.

## Development project
* Beginning Apr 2020, in progress.
* SFU Archives and Artefactual reviewed the scoping report and agreed to proceed with four features; these are tagged on the Issues tab as `in progress`.

[Column pickers in Archivematica's `Backlog` and `Archival storage` tabs (issue 8)](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/8)
* Allow users to choose which fields to display in lists of backlog packages and AIPs.

[Archivematica configuration selector (issue 9)](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/9)
* Let users select a processing configuration when starting a transfer in the Archivematica Dashboard.

[Improvements in the display of digital object metadata in AtoM (issue 10)](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/10)
* Distinguish metadata (e.g. file formats) separately for originals, preservation and access copies
* Make clear when a digital object exists in AtoM (can be directly accessed) vs when a digital object exists (and can be requested) but has not been uploaded to AtoM (for privacy or copyright reasons) and cannot be directly accessed.

[CAS integration (issue 28)](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/software-development-priorities/issues/28)
* Allow Archives' staff to log on to both Archivematica and AtoM via the university's Central Authentication Service using their SFU computing ID.
